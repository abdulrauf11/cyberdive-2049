  Uncle Tetsu has a unique journey, which has now continued to Pakistan.
  Tetsushi Mizokami founded the original Uncle Tetsu in 1990 in Fukuoka, Japan.
  At the core of the cafe’s success was Uncle Tetsu’s famous Japanese
  Cheesecake, which is craved for its unique flavour and soufflé-like texture.
  After the initial success in Japan, the company launched cafes and bakeries in
  20+ countries across the globe with over 100 products.
