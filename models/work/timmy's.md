  As an emerging fast-food chain, Timmy’s needed to boost their organic reach on
  social platforms through quality content over their social platforms. Having
  an in-house team requiring a strategy on which they can rely on in a
  face-paced competitive environment.
solution: >-
  We curated a social media strategy which the team could follow and sample
  content that is visually powerful, engaging and at the same time ignite the
  cravings for fast food on social canvases where the audience actually lives.
  We crafted the content for Instagram stories along with feed posts that are
  visually more appealing to the fast-food enthusiasts and general consumers.
